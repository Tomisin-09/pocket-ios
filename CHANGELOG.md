## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Renamed the product from "Ore" to **Pocket** (module, targets, bundle id
  `click.decooperations.pocket`, repo `pocket-ios`, all docs). Dropped the
  Yoruba "friend" etymology, which no longer applies to the new name.

### Added
- Project scaffold (Phase 0): repo structure, XcodeGen `project.yml`, SwiftLint
  config, GitHub Actions (lint + build + test on PR; TestFlight on merge),
  Fastlane stubs.
- `SongRef` — source-agnostic song identity (local files + Apple Music), unit-tested.
- `TempoMath` — pure tempo/speed-slider/automator math, unit-tested.
- Design tokens, app entry point, placeholder home screen.
- Governance docs: `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, ADRs 0001–0002.
- `docs/design-brief.md` — self-contained design brief + working protocol for
  designing the UI with Claude (design system contract, screen inventory,
  per-screen request template, definition-of-done).
- Infrastructure stub for the Phase 4 Claude proxy.

/// Pure state machine for the **A/B span** — the loop-creation primitive (ADR 0041).
///
/// Models the play-along tap cycle and the span's ordering, free of
/// SwiftUI/AVFoundation so the cycle — the logic that breaks silently without
/// coverage — is exhaustively unit-tested (AGENTS.md). The associated `Loop` for a
/// range-edit write-back lives on the model, not here, so this type stays pure.
///
/// The cycle mirrors a practice player's A-B-repeat button:
///
///     idle ──tap──▶ armed(A) ──tap──▶ set(A↔B) ──tap──▶ idle ──▶ …
///
/// First tap drops **A** at the playhead; the second closes the span to **A↔B**
/// (ordered, widened to the gesture floor); a third clears it. The closed span loops
/// ephemerally until promoted to a saved loop or cleared.
///
/// The song's `duration` is threaded through the two closing calls because the floor is
/// **half a second**, not a fraction of the song (ADR 0199) — the type stays pure, it just
/// takes one more number.

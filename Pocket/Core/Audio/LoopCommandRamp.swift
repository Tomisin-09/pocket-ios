/// (ADR 0046, Phase B). A loop trains the *same* warm-up → dwell → reach → back-off shape as a
/// metronome `Exercise`, but its tempo is a fraction of original (`×`), not absolute BPM — so the
/// `×` working / command / reach are expressed as **integer percent-of-original** (`0.85×` → `85`)
/// and fed to `CommandRamp` unchanged. `CommandRamp` is reused, not forked: the plateau math,
/// live cursor, and completion all work on percent, and `RoutineStairs` renders it as-is.
///
/// Intervals are counted in **loop repetitions** — one pass through the region is one step, which is
/// how a loop is actually practised ("play it through, then bump it up"). A loop has no metronome
/// bars, so the ramp reuses `CommandRamp`'s `.bars` interval mechanism with "bars" reinterpreted as
/// *loop passes*: the run driver feeds `PracticeAudioEngine.loopIteration` as the elapsed count.
/// That count is **rate-independent** (it counts musical repetitions, not frames), so a plateau
/// holds a fixed number of reps regardless of the tempo it plays at. Pure and UI-free so the percent
/// rounding (the kind of tempo math that breaks silently) is unit-tested per AGENTS.md.
